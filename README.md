# Physiological-Impacts-of-ASMR-on-Stress
This study investigates how ASMR and distraction affect heart rate and blood pressure in university students. Results show ASMR lowers physiological arousal, while distractions raise it. Findings suggest ASMR has relaxation potential but is highly sensitive to environmental interruptions.

### Overview

This project investigates how Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) and varying levels of distraction influence physiological responses, specifically heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). While ASMR is commonly associated with relaxation, this study examines how interruptions alter its effects.

## Research Question

*To what extent do ASMR exposure duration and distraction severity alter HR and BP in students?*

**Background**

ASMR: Known for tingling sensations and stress relief; may activate the parasympathetic nervous system.

Distraction: External stimuli that activate sympathetic responses, increasing HR and BP.

Gap: Few studies assess how ASMR interacts with distractions in real-world conditions.

**Participants**

A sample size of 10 participants at the University of Toronto was randomly selected through an interest form.
Post-secondary students at the University of Toronto

**Experiment**

Stimuli:

1. Relaxing ASMR video

2. Distractions introduced during ASMR exposure:

    i. Level 1: Ball rolling

    ii. Level 2: Phone alarm

    iii. Level 3: Jumpscare image

Procedure:

Baseline HR/BP readings

ASMR exposure with mid-session distractions

Post-distraction recovery phase

Measurements taken every ~40â€“45 seconds

Data Collection

Heart Rate (HR): beats per minute

Blood Pressure (BP): systolic/diastolic

Measured with a dual HR-BP monitor

Analysis Tools

R Programming Language

Interaction plots, ANOVA, regression models

Residual Q-Q plots + Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality

**Results**

ASMR: Reduced HR and BP consistently, confirming a relaxation effect.

Distractions: All increased HR/BP; Level 2 (alarm) caused the strongest response.

Statistical Significance: Results trended toward significance but limited by small sample size.

**Conclusion**

Key Insight: Moderate distractions may elicit stronger physiological responses than severe ones, supporting cognitive load theory.

Limitations: Small n, potential outliers, and variability in distraction delivery.

Future Work: Larger datasets, automated stimulus presentation, and longitudinal studies.
