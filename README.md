# The Physiological Impact of ASMR and Distraction on Heart Rate and Blood Pressure
This study investigates how ASMR and distraction affect heart rate and blood pressure in university students. Results show ASMR lowers physiological arousal, while distractions raise it. Findings suggest ASMR has relaxation potential but is highly sensitive to environmental interruptions.

## Overview

This project investigates how Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) and varying levels of distraction influence physiological responses, specifically heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). While ASMR is commonly associated with relaxation, this study examines how interruptions alter its effects.

## Research Question

*To what extent do ASMR exposure duration and distraction severity alter Heart Rate and Blood Pressure in students?*

## Background

**ASMR:** Known for tingling sensations and stress relief; may activate the parasympathetic nervous system.

**Distraction:** External stimuli that activate sympathetic responses, increasing HR and BP.

**Gap:** Few studies assess how ASMR interacts with distractions in real-world conditions.

## Participants

A sample size of 10 participants at the University of Toronto was randomly selected through an interest form.
Post-secondary students at the University of Toronto

## Experiment

### Stimuli:

1. Relaxing ASMR video

2. Distractions introduced during ASMR exposure:

    i. Level 1: Object Falling

    ii. Level 2: Phone alarm

    iii. Level 3: Video with Jumpscare

### Procedure:

Baseline HR/BP readings were taken to establish participants' norms. Then they were exposed to a distraction level to examine how HR/BP could impact the HR/BP. Measurements were taken every 40-45 seconds, using an HR/BP monitor. Following testing procedures, several R programs were created to analyze the data, resulting in Interaction plots, ANOVA, regression models, Residual Q-Q plots, and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality.
